description: Interesting Data Science Projects 

My name is Avery Quinn. I am a data scientist and a financial counselor.

What else do you need?

### My history

Since high school, I had a strong desire to advise people about personal finance. After completing my Masters in Finance, I began working as a financial counselor. During that time, I discovered I really liked creating financial models to help others. That lead me to coding and learning more about computer science.
