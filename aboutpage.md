<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
<h6>Call me the Investigator: Enneagram Type 5</h6>

My name is Avery Quinn. I am a data scientist and a financial counselor.  


### My History
Ever since taking my first required personal finance course in high school, finance has been my passion. After meeting two of my favorite coaches, Christy Wright and Dave Ramsey, I decided to study insurance and finance. I still remember creating one of my first financial models to calculate how much a person would have at retirement using various investment tools. As I continued through college, I got to take an econometrics course and use SAS statistical software to manipulate data and conduct forecasts. It reminded me of a basic programming class I took in high school, but never explored that interest further.

With my love of numbers and business analytics, I thought data science would be a perfect fit for me. That curiosity has carried me through continuing my education through Lambda School. After four years of trying to learn Spanish, I'm surprised how quick and fun learning the Python programming language has been. With all the resources available to me, teachers, friends, Stack Overflow, and other online tools, I'm always excited to learn more, solve problems, and build things I never thought I could make.
