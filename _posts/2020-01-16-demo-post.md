<p> The website [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/) covers a variety of news from sports, politics, and economics. However, they are also known for their visualizations. There is also a FiveThirtyEight style sheet in the Matplotlib library.</p>  
`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  
plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')`

<p> Using figure/axes syntax, you can also create attractive visualizations. Every plot has an outer section called the figure or background, and the inner section is referred to as the axes (or subplot if displaying multiple axes). Learning the [anatomy](https://matplotlib.org/3.2.1/gallery/showcase/anatomy.html) of a plot allows you to manipulate it's features.</p>

<p> Start by generating figure (fig) and axes (ax) objects. `fig, ax = plt.subplots()` Now calling on `fig` or `ax` allows you to customize or control any aspect on the plot. </p>  
`
# set figure background color  
fig.patch.set(facecolor='xkcd:mint green')  
# change the axes to yellow 
ax.set(facecolor="yellow")
`

<p> Okay, that's a flashy combination, but you get the point. You can manipulate numerous features of a plot to make your visualization express what you would like your audience to see. Here are a list of axes attributes that might come in *handy*:</p>  
* Title  
`ax.set_title("Title Name Here", fontsize=20)`
* Legend  
`ax.legend()`
* X axis label  
`ax.set_xlabel("X axis label")`
* Y axis label  
`ax.set_ylabel("Y axis label")`
* Major and Minor Ticks  
`ax.set_xticks()`
* Major and Minor Tick Labels  
`ax.set_xticklabels()`
* Spines  
`ax.spines['right'].set_color('none')`

<p> Here a two charts I found on FiveThirtyEight.com that I decided to reproduce. The [first](https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/chalabi-datalab-sleep-two1.png?w=575) is a vertical bar graph. The [second](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-mona-how-many-couples-sleep-in-separate-beds/) was a bit more challenging. It's a horizontal bar graph of the reasons why couple sleep apart.</p>
