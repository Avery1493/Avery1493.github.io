Believe it or not, I struggled a long time deciding what I wanted to do with my life. I finally discovered my problem was that I wanted to do a lot of things, but just couldnâ€™t decide on the right order!

In May of 2019, I applied to Nashville Software School. I also applied for a financial counseling position at a mortgage company. Simultaneously, I was accepted into the school with a partial diversity scholarship and offered the job position. I was equally excited about both paths.

I had always loved math growing up. I even tutored algebra, statistics, and basic finance throughout high school and college. During college, I studied finance and insurance. I absolutely enjoyed it and graduated debt free with a masterâ€™s in finance. I interned at a few companies before ultimately accepting the position with the mortgage company. After a few months, I realized I wasnâ€™t fully content working at my job. In the back of my mind, I constantly wondered where I would be if had I decided to start that computer science program.

Around this same time, my best friend began attending Lambda, an online coding school. She told me about her program and that intrigued my interested. I went back and forth for a while in my head about what step should I take.  I was doing well at my job, meeting my monthly performance goals, and making a few friends. Ultimately, however, I just could not sleep knowing that I was passing up an opportunity I might regret.  

After applying for Lambda, I worked hard after getting off from work and on the weekends to complete the precourse work for the program. Once I was accepted, I got up the courage to put in my two weeks notice at my job. I do miss it a bit, but Iâ€™m excited for this new journey as well.

My goal for the future is to work as a data scientist. I want to progress and make a better life for my family. I also want to encourage other girls and minorities to get involved in tech. Lastly, I want to use my skills to develop math and personal finance apps and games for children and young adults.
