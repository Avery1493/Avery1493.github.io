<p>Believe it or not, I struggled a long time deciding what I wanted to do with my life. I finally discovered my problem was that I wanted to do a lot of things, but just couldnâ€™t decide on the right order!<p/>

<p>In May of 2019, I applied to Nashville Software School. I also applied for a financial counseling position at a mortgage company. Simultaneously, I was accepted into the school with a partial diversity scholarship and offered the job position. I was equally excited about both paths.<p/>

<p>I had always loved math growing up. I even tutored algebra, statistics, and basic finance throughout high school and college. During college, I studied finance and insurance. I absolutely enjoyed it and graduated debt free with a masterâ€™s in finance. I interned at a few companies before ultimately accepting the position with the mortgage company. After a few months, I realized I wasnâ€™t fully content working at my job. In the back of my mind, I constantly wondered where I would be if had I decided to start that computer science program.<p/>

<p>Around this same time, my best friend began attending Lambda, an online coding school. She told me about her program and that intrigued my interested. I went back and forth for a while in my head about what step should I take.  I was doing well at my job, meeting my monthly performance goals, and making a few friends. Ultimately, however, I just could not sleep knowing that I was passing up an opportunity I might regret.<p/>

<p>After applying for Lambda, I worked hard after getting off from work and on the weekends to complete the precourse work for the program. Once I was accepted, I got up the courage to put in my two weeks notice at my job. I do miss it a bit, but Iâ€™m excited for this new journey as well.<p/>

<p>My goal for the future is to work as a data scientist. I want to progress and make a better life for my family. I also want to encourage other girls and minorities to get involved in tech. Lastly, I want to use my skills to develop math and personal finance apps and games for children and young adults.<p/>
